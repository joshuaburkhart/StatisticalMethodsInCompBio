> Our dataset contains 1813 rows labelled 1 (spam) and 2788 rows labelled 0 (not spam) for a 61% (non spam) to 39% (spam) split. As a constant (naive) classifier could achieve a 39% misclassification rate by ouputting 0 (non spam) for each example, we'll hope to develop a classifier with a lower misclassification rate.

```{r}
spam.df %>% dim()
spam.df[,58] %>% table()
1813/spam.df %>% nrow()
2788/spam.df %>% nrow()
